From the original Scheme version of 'Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs'. Exercise 1.9 gives two procedures and asks the reader to illustrate the processes generated by each procedure in the evaluation of `(+ 4 5)`, further asking if these processes are iterative or recursive.

<!-- more -->

The definitions of the procedures are as follows:

```scheme
(define (+.1 a b)
  (if (= a 0)
    b
    (inc (+.1 (dec a) b))))

(define (+.2 a b)
  (if (= a 0)
    b
    (+.2 (dec a) (inc b))))
```

(In the original publication, both functions were defined with the same name. To reduce ambiguity, I have elected to give them unique names.)

Let's look at the first function, `+.1`. 

```scheme
(+.1 4 5)
-> (inc (+ (dec 4) 5))
-> (inc (inc (+ (dec 3) 5)))
-> (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 2) 5))))
-> (inc (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 1) 5)))))
-> (inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
-> (inc (inc (inc 6)))
-> (inc (inc 7))
-> (inc 8)
-> 9
```

This procedure is a recursive procedure and it produces a recursive process. The expansion and subsequent contraction seen in the substitution model is characteristic of **linearly recursive processes**.

```scheme
(+.2 4 5)
-> (+.2 (dec 4) (inc 5))
-> (+.2 (dec 3) (inc 6))
-> (+.2 (dec 2) (inc 7))
-> (+.2 (dec 1) (inc 8))
-> 9
```

This procedure is also a recursive proedure, but it utilises tail-call recursion and thus the process it defines is **linearly iterative**. 

## Takeaways

I am still making my way through SICP, but this 'technique' of looking at the shape of the substitution model of how a process evolves clearly offers a level of observational ability in determining the relative efficiency of procedures.
