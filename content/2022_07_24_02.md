From the original Scheme version of 'Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs'. Exercise 1.9 gives two procedures and asks the reader to illustrate the processes generated by each procedure in the evaluation of `(+ 4 5)`, further asking if these processes are iterative or recursive.

<!-- more -->

The definitions of the procedures are as follows:

```scheme
(define (+.1 a b)
  (if (= a b)
    b
    (inc (+ (dec a) b))))

(define (+.2 a b)
  (if (= a 0)
    b
    (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
```
